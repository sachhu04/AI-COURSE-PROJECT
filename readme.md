# Movie Genre Predictor

This project focuses on predicting the genre of a movie based on its textual information using machine learning techniques. The goal is to understand how well text-based features can be used to classify movies into different genres.

---

## Problem Statement
Movies are often associated with one or more genres, which helps users discover content aligned with their interests. Manually categorizing movies can be time-consuming and subjective. This project aims to build a model that can automatically predict a movie’s genre using available textual data.

---

## Dataset
- The dataset contains movie-related text data such as titles, descriptions, or plot summaries.
- Each movie is associated with a genre label.
- The data was preprocessed to remove noise and make it suitable for machine learning models.

---

## Approach
The project follows these steps:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Text vectorization using NLP techniques
3. Exploratory data analysis to understand genre distribution
4. Model training and evaluation
5. Performance comparison and result analysis

---

## Techniques and Models Used
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- TF-IDF / Count Vectorization
- Machine Learning classifiers such as:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - Other baseline models for comparison

---

## Results and Insights
- The model is able to predict movie genres with reasonable accuracy.
- Certain genres are easier to predict due to distinctive language patterns.
- Text preprocessing and feature selection play a major role in improving performance.

Detailed results and analysis are provided in the notebook and the project report.
