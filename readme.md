# Movie Genre Predictor

This project focuses on predicting the genre of a movie using textual information and machine learning techniques. The objective is to understand how effectively natural language data can be used to classify movies into different genres.

---

## Problem Statement
Movies are commonly categorized by genre to help users discover relevant content. Manual genre tagging can be subjective and time-consuming. This project aims to automate genre prediction using machine learning models trained on movie-related text data.

---

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of movie text data such as titles, descriptions, or plot summaries.
- Each movie entry is associated with a genre label.
- The data was cleaned and preprocessed before model training.

---

## Approach
The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Text vectorization using NLP techniques
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Model training and evaluation
5. Performance analysis and comparison

---

## Techniques and Models Used
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Text vectorization (TF-IDF / Count Vectorizer)
- Machine learning models such as:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression

---

## Results and Insights
- The trained model is able to predict movie genres with reasonable accuracy.
- Certain genres are easier to classify due to distinctive vocabulary patterns.
- Feature extraction and preprocessing significantly impact model performance.

Detailed analysis and results are available in the notebook and the project report.
